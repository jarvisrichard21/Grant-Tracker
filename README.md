#Sales_TrendAnalysis

Overview
This project blends data analysis with operational strategy to investigate sales performance within my department at Kroger. Over a four-week period, I tracked weekly sales for two key retail categories: General Merchandise (Drug GM) and Health & Beauty Care (HBC).
Key Insight
HBC sales remained relatively stable, while Drug GM showed signs of decline. This contrast prompted a deeper analysis into promotional effectiveness and replenishment patterns for top-selling SKUs in Drug GM.
Objective
To identify actionable strategies that could improve Drug GM performance by leveraging insights from HBCâ€™s stability and operational interventions.
