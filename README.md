# Grant Tracker
## ðŸ§  Philosophy Behind This Project

This grant tracker is more than a toolâ€”it's a sandbox for learning, iteration, and strategic growth.

Iâ€™m embracing spontaneity and acting on what I feel in the moment. Mistakes are expected, welcomed, and treated as feedback loops. When I hit a wall, I step back, reframe the problem, gather context, and dive back in with fresh perspective.

This is how entrepreneurs solve problemsâ€”not by knowing everything, but by staying curious, resilient, and intentional.
